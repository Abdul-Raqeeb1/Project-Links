# My Web Development Work (7 Months Progress)

Hello! 👋

This folder contains all the websites and assignments I have built in the past 7 months while learning web development.

## 📁 Inside this folder

You will find a **text file** that includes links to all my projects. Each link will open a website or assignment that I have created. These projects show my progress and learning journey.

## ✅ What You Can See

- Basic HTML/CSS websites
- JavaScript projects
- Assignments from courses or practice
- Real-world layout clones
- Personal experiments and designs

## 📌 Note

All links are safe and made by me. You can open them one by one from the text file.

Thanks for checking out my work! 😊
